How to build:

* cabal configure 
* cabal install --dependencies-only
* cabal build

In three terminals, start 3 nodes: 

* ./dist/build/mini-distributed-key-value/mini-distributed-key-value main 3001
* ./dist/build/mini-distributed-key-value/mini-distributed-key-value main 3002
* ./dist/build/mini-distributed-key-value/mini-distributed-key-value main 3003


Then in various terminals (possibly distinct), claim slices on the key ring:

* claim 100
* claim 200
* claim 300
* claim 300
* claim 400 ...

Then in other or same terminals, you can set/get values; in possibly different terminals:

* set 42 toto
* get 42
* get 43
* set 155 machin
* get 155 ...
